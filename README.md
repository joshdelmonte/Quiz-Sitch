# Quiz-Sitch
A fun timed quiz for web development!

# Description

    -I've created this App to demonstrate my skills with creating a timed quiz and creating a data bass that records previous users names and their scores.

    -The repo was made to cycle through different pages with a timer during the game, and get a score to give a little feeling of competition and fun.

    -This has proven to be the most tiring and demanding of my challenges, but I feel all the better for having done it and learned a ton of new things along the way.

## Credits

-Credits go to The DU Bootcamp resources their instructors and assistants for all they have taught me. JavaScript is an amazing skill and I'm keen on honing it to the best of my abilities.
And to a Youtube channel called Brian Design. Greatly helped me set up the framework, and understand const and let to help me generate this app.
